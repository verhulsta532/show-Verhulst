My favorite movie is Mulan because it is my go to movie and can never get bored from watching it again. I really like the story and the songs in the movie.

 # Code Snippet
The code snippet I used is showing how to combine dictionaries in python.

```
def merge_dicts(*dicts):
  super_dict = {}
  for dict in dicts:
      for k, v in dict.items():
          super_dict[k] = v

 return super_dict
 ```
